### Abstract
This group project is about generating a mini blockchain using code programming. Building a full blockchain requires complex models, and for this reason, in this project we will only focus on some basic structures. The specific content includes the generation of transaction and blockchain, the Merkle tree, finally the integrity verification. We used python as our code language and build this mini blockchain with some libraries about cryptography. Some other library references include hashlib, json, etc., to help generate blockchains. We divided the project into five parts to allow for division of labour and eventual code integration. The overall code contains several function methods and the final test function, which meets the project requirements and generates the blockchain.

## Artifact Dependencies and Requirements
### Hardware Resources
- T4-GPU in Colab

### Operating Systems
- Google Colab (runs on a cloud-based environment)

### Software Libraries
The following libraries are required and if not using colab, library can be installed via `requirements.txt`:
- `cryptography` (for cryptographic functions)
- `hashlib` (for hashing operations)
- `json` (for data serialization)
- `time` (for time-related functions)
- `random` (for random number generation)

### Input Datasets
- The project does not require external datasets; all input data is generated within the code.

### Other Dependencies
- Internet access for downloading libraries and cloning the GitHub repository.

## Artifact Installation and Deployment Process
### Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
